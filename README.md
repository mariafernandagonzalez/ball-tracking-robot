# Computer Vision Detection and Tracking Robotics Project
A mobile robot that uses computer vision and real-time image processing to detect and track a ball. Developed in Caltechâ€™s Introduction to Robotics course, this project focused on vision-based algorithms, image filtering, and motion planning. The system processes live video input to identify and follow a moving ball, demonstrating autonomous behavior through software-driven control.
